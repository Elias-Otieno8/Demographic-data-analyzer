This project aims to analyze a dataset of adult demographic information to extract key insights. The code calculates various statistics including: the count of each race represented, the average age of men, the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree, and the percentages of high earners (>50K salary) among those with and without higher education. It also determines the minimum work hours per week, the percentage of high earners among those working minimum hours, identifies the country with the highest percentage of high earners, and finds the most popular occupation for high earners in India.
